This walkthrough will not only tell you how to beat the game, but also how to get all 3 game overs.
Remember to use the "look" command to look at everything if you are stuck. It can be very helpful


"go north" into the prison cell
"look bucket" to see a key
"take key" from the bucket
"go west"
"use key" to unlock the door
"go north" through the newly unlocked door
"talk ogre" multiple times. The ogre will give you a hint in order to get through the maze
"go east" into the maze
In order to get through the maze the path is South, East, East, North, East, East.
    (Game over) If you do not follow the path in the maze you will get a game over
"go south" when you escape the maze
"look door" to see it is blocked by rocks
"take rocks" from in front of the door
"use rocks" to break the window
"go south" through the window
"take firepoker" from the fireplace
"user firepoker" to obtain the shield
"go east" into the hallway
    (Game over) "go east" into the room with angry guards to get a game over
"look nightstand" to see the drawer
"look drawer" to find a mirror
"take mirror" from the drawer
"go west" back into the foyer
"go west" up the spiral staircase
"look essence" I consider this the hardest puzzle in the game, and yes that was intended. A final challenge if you will
"talk person" to start the battle with the wizard
    (Game over) "use shield" to get a game over. I thought this would be the obvious choice and would be funny if you got a game over
"use mirror" to win the game
THE END
